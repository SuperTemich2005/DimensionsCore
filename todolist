- Fix TARDIS (find a way to properly propagate dimension value to all interior elements)
- Fix gmod_wire_trigger not propagating its dimension onto gmod_wire_trigger_entity

- cameras render from the current players dimension instead of the dimension the camera is in (not sure if we can fix this)

- sounds still get played in other dimensions >:(
- certain effects are visible in other dimensions (certain parts of stargates opening)
- Touch, StartTouch and EndTouch need to be metatable modified to check for entity dimensions, as you will still trigger certain things (like shields and stargate event horizon teleport)
